## WHY?

I created my own dotfiles for Hyprland 🧩 because other solutions often
felt too complicated ⚙️. Many pre-made configs include far too many
options, making the system confusing and hard to manage 🌀. They also
hide unexpected pitfalls that cause trouble when customizing or updating
⚠️. With my own dotfiles, I keep full control 🖋️, know exactly how
everything works 🧠, and can fine-tune my setup to match my needs
perfectly 🎯.

I’d like to share my dotfiles with other users too 🤝, so they can
benefit from them 💡 and set up their own hyprland environment more
easily 🚀.

With the installation guide below, even beginners with moderate
experience can set it up easily 🛠️✨ — no advanced skills required! 🚀
